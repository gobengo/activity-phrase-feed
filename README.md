# activity-phrase-feed

This is a test making a Web Component to visualize a [stream-feed](https://github.com/gobengo/stream-feed). It assumes that Activities are added to the feed, and uses [activity-phraser](https://github.com/gobengo/activity-phraser) to render them to plaintext.

## Example

* node: `node example.js`
* browser: `make dist` to browserify. Then open [demos/index.html](./demos/index.html)
